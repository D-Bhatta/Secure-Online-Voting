## About

Voting is a right to every citizen. It gives the choice of the people to whom they want to up hold the meaning of a system governed by the peopleâ€™s choice. However, representing elections have become a debatable issue. Different techniques of voting have evolved from simple manual voting to internet voting systems that only require the voter to come from the comfort of their home to vote their candidate from their personal computers. An election system should be able to overcome different hacking and fraud techniques. To overcome different complications and to reinforce the checking and calculating results, the project suggests the use of hashing. Authentication is made by comparing hashes using SHA-256. The system is more secured. Vote can be audited later by comparing hashes in a database.
Online voting or E-voting refers to voting using electronic means to either aid or take care of the chores of casting and counting votes.

Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use computers connected to the internet. It encompasses a range of Internet services, from basic data transmission to full-function online voting through common connectable consumer devices.

The proliferation of personal mobile devices in the form of tablets and smartphones, based on the Android operating system, presents a unique opportunity to empower isolated communities who traditionally have had a difficult time voting.
